# Daily Photos Directory

## How to Update Your Daily Photo:

1. **Keep only ONE photo** in this folder at any time
2. **Any filename works** - no specific naming required (poster.jpg, daily.png, follow-up.jpeg, etc.)
3. **Supported formats**: JPG, JPEG, PNG (any case)
4. **Location**: `/Users/admin/Documents/Appium-test/daily_photos/`

## Steps to Update:
1. **Delete** the old photo from this folder
2. **Copy** your new daily poster here (any image filename is fine)
3. **Ensure** only ONE photo exists in this folder
4. **Run** the script - it will automatically find and use your photo!

## Important:
- ✅ Keep exactly **1 photo** in this folder
- ❌ Don't keep multiple photos (script will warn and use the first one)
- ✅ Any image filename works: `today.jpg`, `poster.png`, `follow-up.jpeg`, etc.

The script will automatically:
- Find the single photo in this folder
- Transfer it to your Android device  
- Attach it to each LuckyTaj chat message
- Send both text message + photo together
